When working with ajax is a good practice to install node.js and npm(server)

-Download node.js from the website:
	https://nodejs.org/en/

-After enter CMD windows and run the comands:
	1)node -v
	2)npm -v
	3)npm install live-server -g 		(to make it global and run anywhere)
	4)enter your folder through the cmd
		-cd /downloads/anotações...
	5)after that the server will be running, and you can open your html doc on your chrome( or other) and star coding
	6)Mine open on the link http://127.0.0.1:8080/indexAjax.html
-You can also use XAMPP

-RUN 4 5 AND 6 WHEN NECESSARY TO CODE
